# Ready Set Crypto - On-chain Masterclass

The Ready Set Crypto On-chain Masterclass has been designed to help you study and understand the fundamental behaviour of cryptro-assets, as it happens, on-chain.

At the core, on-chain analysis is the process of distiling information presented by a blockchain network into actionable signals and edge in the market. Behind every transaction is a set of incentives, human psychology and most importantly, a concious decision to sign with a private key.

Each blockchain has a unique set of mechanics and user behaviour patterns that make it tick. By studying this information, we can gain insight to the blockchain's heartbeat and build models, indicators and probability frameworks that help us find edge and make strong decisions in the market.

## Contents

This masterclass has a number of components, each designed to progressively upskill and leverage lessons learned along the way.

The broad contents include:

- On-chain Masdterclass Modules - A structured flow of learning modules designed to introduce each metric, show how it can be applied and build foundational knowledge. This Masterclass will include practical applications and how to apply it during all market conditions.

- Weekly Market Update and AMA delivered by Checkmate - These sessions are dynamic and will cover a variety of metrics which are relevant at the time. Each session will be around 30-45mins long (depending on how busy things are in the market and on-chain) with time for questions and suggested content to cover by you.

- Access to the RSC charting suite for all on-chain indicators covered in the modules as a tool to help you identify edge and execute your strategy.

At this stage, the content is focused specifically on two blockchains, Bitcoin and Decred which each have comparable but unique on-chain signatures. The lessons you learn will help build a solid on-chain analysis foundation which you can use to expand and interpret many other crypto-asset networks.
