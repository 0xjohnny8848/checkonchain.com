DECRED FORCES BITCOIN TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE

There is a characteristic of the Decred community that is less common in the dogmatic ideas of many alt-coin communities. Decred-heads are open to the reality where Bitcoin succeeds or doesn't. Decred is constructed, purposed and tooled both to catch the slack and

        - 

At the end of the day, these assets are software and the ease of accepting a multitude as payments is near trivial. Serving different features, the best privacy solution for Bitcoin could be DCR.
