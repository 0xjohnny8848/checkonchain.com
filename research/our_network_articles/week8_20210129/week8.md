# Our Network - Week 8


## Insight 1 - Onchain Balance

Decred is a hybrid Proof-of-Work + Proof-of-Stake network, and with this comes fascinating on-chain supply and demand dynamics. The **On-Chain Balance** is a tool developed to measure the supply issuance (PoW+PoS block rewards) versus staking demand (DCR flows into tickets) by netting the balances against each other over a 30-day period.

In 2017, there were three large positive spikes in Onchain Balance (greater flow into tickets than issuance), which all supported an appreciation in price. 2020/2021 has seen five such spikes with net overflow of 460k DCR into tickets. Most recently, Onchain balance has seen the largest ever relative inflow to tickets supporting a doubling in DCRBTC price.

## Insight 2 - Supply Staked in Tickets ATH

Staking within the Decred ecosystem is a pseuo-random timelock of value representing “skin in the game”. Stakers relinquish coin liquidity to secure the network and voting rights in return for a share of the block reward.

The charts below track the USD & BTC prices where DCR have been staked over the entire network’s lifetime. By glancing at this data we can track potential profit, loss, and breakeven levels for the Decred’s biggest bulls.

USD chart takeaway:
-  Only 17% of DCR ever staked has occurred above $40, signaling HODLers are currently in heavy profit on a USD basis.
BTC chart takeaway:
-  The important breakeven point seems to be ~.004 DCRBTC, as above this level only 60% of stakers will be in profit on their principal on a BTC basis.

## Insight 3 - CoinShuffle++ Volume ATH

Decred is in the process of releasing a significant wallet GUI upgrade which supports the CoinShuffle++ Privacy mixing implementation. Over the past month, wallet release clients have been tested by the community with a corresponding boost to the daily volume flowing through the CoinShuffle++ mixer.

On 28 November, daily mixed volume reached a new ATH of 272.6k DCR, at the time equivalent to $5.94M in value. The 30-day average daily mix volume has increased 50% from the long term average of ~100k to over 150k DCR per day. Since August 2019, a total volume of 45.6M DCR has been anonymised (over 3.7x circulating supply!).

## Insight 4 - DCRDEX Atomic Swaps

Decred recently released the MVP implementation of DCRDEX, a decentralised exchange that utilises atomic swap technology. A DCRDEX server may be hosted by any entity, each with full and permissionless autonomy over which market pairs they list.

The DCRDEX server that is hosted by the Decred project has been publicly live with a DCR/BTC pair for 48-days. To date, a total of 597.5k DCR has been traded, representing 30% of the equivalent volume on Binance. Price on the DEX has also maintained close parity with that trading on centralised exchanges.

## Insight 5 - Decred Lightning Network

Finally, Decred's implementation of the Lightning Network is now live and operational on Mainnet. The GUI is built into release client wallets and is in the early stages of live experimentation by the community.

In the first month, the Decred Lightning Network has established 26 Nodes, 47 Channels and supports a total capacity of 11.58DCR. Early days but certainly an exciting step towards seeing the Lightning Network growing on Decred.
